# Price Lens

Price Lens is a project for tracking supermarket prices and all the goods that come from that. The idea for the project came from a desire to gather inflation data into the future and help shoppers be aware of what the shelves do not tell the buyer.

Tracking portuguese supermarkets: Continente, Auchan, Pingo Doce and more to come. Started in December 2024.
