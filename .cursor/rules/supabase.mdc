## Supabase details

- Our project is free tier AFAIK.
- We do not use a local database. We use the same in production and local to save overhead even if that is dangerous.
- Supabase has a limit of 1000 when presenting results sometimes. When making queries we need to handle this as if results can be way more than that hard limit, using pagination perhaps.image.png
